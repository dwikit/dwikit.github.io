								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/profilePic.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p> 
									My name is David Wikstrom, and I’m an aspiring Virtual Reality developer based out of Seattle, Washington. 
									Virtual Reality has been something that has fascinated me since I was very young, and due to somewhat recent 
									developments in my life I now have the opportunity, skills, and determination to build the virtual worlds and 
									experiences that have always fascinated me.
								</p>
								<p> 
									I have recently graduated from Bellevue College in Washington State with a Bachelor’s Degree in Application Development. I will use the coding 
									skills and foundations that I have gained throughout my time going back to school to further sharpen and increase my skill set to pursue my 
									goals. I wish to use the skills that I have gained to build XR applications in order to help people. Through the development of medical, 
									therapeutic, educational, skill-building, storytelling, and experiences that bring the users’ joy.   
								</p>
								<p>
									A quick breakdown of my skills and the technologies I have experience working with can be found here: <a style="font-weight:bold" href="#skills">Skills</a>.
								</p>
								<h3>more about me</h3>
								<p> 
									The following sections will briefly cover my personal growth and experiences from my <a style="font-weight:bold" href="#childhood">childhood</a>, 
									time living in <a style="font-weight:bold" href="#japan">Japan</a>, my <a style="font-weight:bold" href="#military">military experience</a>, 
									going back to <a style="font-weight:bold" href="#college">Bellevue College</a> for my bachelor’s degree, and my 
									<a style="font-weight:bold" href="#life"> married life</a>.

								<div id="childhood"><h2>Childhood</h2>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/polePosition.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/Tron.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p style="clear: both;">
										I’ve loved the concept of virtual worlds ever since I played my first video game, Pole Position, on the Atari 2600. 
										This fascination continued to grow and develop as I was exposed to one of my favorite movies, Tron. Through this 
										mind-boggling 1982 perfection, my imagination was ignited with the idea of being pulled into other dimensions and experiences 
										that could transform reality. My curiosity continued to be fueled with the release of The Matrix and with escaping through various 
										video games and immersive story experiences throughout the years.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div id="japan"><h2>Japan</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/temple.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										My time in Japan may not be directly connected to my interest in XR, but experiencing another vastly different culture from my own 
										humbled me and opened my eyes to locational realities within our world. It taught me to appreciate and explore a life that is distinct 
										and unique, showing me that until that point, I had only known one reality, my own. Through my time in Japan, I was privileged to learn 
										enough of the language, enabling me to form deep relationships and explore the culture through food, music, and art.
									</p>
								</div>
								<br>
								<div id="military"><h2>Military</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/mil.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										During my teen years, I spent my summers  working at fisheries in Alaska putting in over 100 hours a week, so the value of hard work 
										was a concept instilled in me very early in life. This followed me as I enlisted with the United States Air Force as an Electrical 
										and Environmental Systems Specialist, which offered me the opportunity to gain a new set of skills through working with complex military 
										systems. I gained a deep understanding	of troubleshooting and completing tasks in high-pressure situations with little to no room for 
										error. As I rose in rank, I achieved leadership positions, training my superiors and younger airmen, which solidified me as a highly 
										valued specialist in my field. In doing so, I gained teamwork and leadership experience along with an understanding of how to manage 
										teams during stressful situations.
									</p>
								</div>
								<br>
								<div id="college"><h2>Bellevue College</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.PNG" alt="" /></span>									
									<p style="clear: both;">
										While my time in the Air Force was invaluable, it pushed my body to the limits resulting in a disability and a 
										medical discharge from the Air Force. With my career at a crossroads, I had a decision to make, wallow in self-pity and loss of purpose 
										or find a new purpose and move forth with my life. I chose the latter and started exploring different paths. While I have always been 
										passionate about Virtual Reality, I also want to help people. Still, most positions require some type of formal degree, so I ultimately 
										decided to enroll in Bellevue College to pursue my bachelor’s degree. The time in which I enrolled into the college was also the first 
										quarter that the College was offering its first-ever accredited Virtual Reality course. It was fate, and I signed up immediately.
									</p>										
									<p> 
										Within this class, we had to choose either to write a research paper or create a virtual reality application. I chose the much harder 
										path of creating a virtual reality application, with having no experience with coding or creating applications of any kind. I took it 
										as a challenge and taught myself the basics of coding in C# and Unity. The creation of my first object and interaction with that object 
										in a virtual world brought me back to the same feeling I had as a child playing on the Atari 2600. I had found my new purpose. Since 
										then, I changed my major to Application Development, and over the course of the last 3 years, I have dedicated my studies to learn about 
										the creation of Virtual Reality applications. Over these years, I've gained skills and knowledge from completing projects and utilizing 
										various programming languages, frameworks, databases, and libraries through game engines such as Unity and Unreal and web development. 
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/altPres.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										While at Bellevue College, I also had the opportunity to volunteer my time with the VR Club as their vice president for 3 years. This 
										allowed me to spread more awareness about XR and introduce the technology to new students as they joined Bellevue College. 
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/classShowing.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										I was also employed with Bellevue College’s XR Lab as a senior lab assistant and worked with a team to get this technology into the hands of 
										students using equitable practices. Through research into available applications, we augmented teachers’ classrooms by providing workshops 
										and creating virtual reality curriculum for their courses.
									</p>

								<div id="life"><h2>Married Life</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/lantern.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										I met my wife on the inter-webs, and we went to sushi for our first date. (^-^) We have been married for about 3 years and we live with our two dogs, 
										Tofu and Bean. Tofu is scared of everything including his own shadow, and Bean loves everything but also tries to fight everything. 
										Bean's a little ball of energy, and Tofu is content as long as nothing is near him.

									<h3>VR Anatomy Viewer</h3>								
										<p>
											The Bellevue College VR Anatomy Viewer is a teaching tool created to teach users about human anatomy within 
											an interactive virtual reality environment. My Agile team consisted of five people and we created this application 
											over the course of six months, less than three of which were actual development time.

									<h3>VR Music Cubes</h3>
										<p>
											This was the first VR project I had ever created, and that too with little to no coding or Unity experience. Through the three months it 
											took to complete this project, I realized my passion and drive for virtual reality, leading me to explore and create more VR-focused 
											experiences.

									<h3>Belleuve College IBIT Capstone VR Class</h3>
										<p>
											This was a time-sensitive XR Lab VR project that sprung up because of the class's interest in virtual reality. 
											The scenario was that the teacher of the capstone class wanted, during these separated times of COVID, to bring 
											everyone together and have class in VR before the quarter was out. Less than two weeks were left in the quarter, but my team 
											and I were able to find a platform, build a classroom, and distribute VR headsets to the entire class, and provided 
											recorded video instructions for the students unfamiliar with the technology. This project was a great success and ended 
											up being the first-ever full virtual reality class session held for Bellevue College.

								<h3>Proposal</h3>
								<p>
									This project was put forth and proposed by Bellevue College's Medical Sciences Division in collaboration with the XR Lab. 
									My team was assigned to the project, and we worked with our client, a cardiologist of over 40 years, and the Ultrasound Lab professor 
									at the college.
								</p>
								<h3>Team</h3>
								<p>
									Our team was an Agile SCRUM team, of which I was the Product Owner. We also had a SCRUM Master, two team members on the 
									development team, and a data analyst. As our team was very small the Product Owner and SCRUM Master were also considered 
									part of the develepment team. The original project proposal was to use ultrasound datasets and build a system to 
									visualize the human heart using those datasets in a 3D virtual environment.  
								</p>
								<h3>Scope</h3>
								<p>
									The project ended up shifting dramatically from this initial proposal as more information was gathered through investigation. 
									Our client wanted a more open, scalable teaching tool that taught users about human anatomy in VR, and he wanted an easy tool to 
									use that provided information on human anatomy. From these gathered requirements, feasibility and design stages took place, and the 
									VR Anatomy Viewer was born. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Our product scope for this project was to have an intractable heart that had a label system, could be scaled up, made transparent, 
									and have controllable animation and audio. Through further testing and prototyping, we found also needed a way to rotate the heart. 
									We also needed an environment and lighting, and this was our initial scope. Contracts with the client were then finalized, and our team 
									had a little less than 3 months left to complete the project.
								</p>
								<h3>Prototypying and Testing</h3>	
								<p>
									We prototyped and tested out different interactions and assets in a test project and then brought them over to the main project after testing.
								</p>							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/testing.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Documentation, Communication, and Version Control</h3>
								<p>
									We used Trello for our Agile board, task tracking, and visual progress. We also used SharePoint for documentation, Discord for communication,
									 and GitHub, as well as Unity Collaborate for version control. 
								</p>
								<h3>Open VR</h3>
								<p>
									As this is a Bellevue College application, our team needed to target the VR devices that the college's XR Lab had available. We decided 
									to use SteamVR and the OpenVR API to support all of the devices that we needed to target.
								</p>
								
								<h3>Development</h3>
								<p>
									As the Product Owner, I set up our meetings, relayed information from our client to the rest of the team, and built out our team's product 
									backlog. Also, because I was part of the development team as well, I worked on any and every task that I could get my hands on. Our team 
									worked in one-week sprints to complete our tasks. We would refine our backlog, have a Sprint Planning meeting at the start of each week, 
									daily check-ins on discord, have a Sprint Review meeting at the end of the week, and hold a Sprint Retrospective meeting afterward.
								</p>

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/g2.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/g3.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Challenges</h3>
								<p>
									During the course of development, our team ran into many challenges that we would eventually overcome. The difficulties presented by COVID-19, 
									personal challenges for each team member, standard issues of blockers on certain tasks, merge conflicts, GitHub file size restrictions, time, etc. 
									As a team, we overcame these challenges together and supported each other through difficult times.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/g4.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Project Completion</h3>
								<p>
									Our team completed the project's scope within the allotted timeframe, and we presented the completed application to our client and Bellevue 
									College's Medical Sciences Division. They were thrilled at how the project turned out and are excited to build on it with future capstone 
									teams. The project was a great success for my team, our client, the XR Lab, and Bellevue College, and I am excited to see where the future 
									leads.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cubeBanner.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									As this was the first project I had ever attempted to create using a 3D engine like Unity and I hadn't coded anything before, 
									I needed a plan. 
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Gain a basic understanding of Unity.</li>
									<li>Gain knowledge of C#.</li>
									<li>Gain a basic understanding of audio structure.</li>
									<li>Prototype and create a proof of concept using knowledge gained.</li>
									<li>Add VR support.</li>
									<li>Research how to create a compelling 3D environment.</li>
									<li>Refine the user's gameplay experience.</li>
									<li>Gather feedback and make adjustments as needed.</li>
									<li>Put finishing touches in and make any needed visual changes.</li>
									<li>Deliver completed experience by project deadline.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>First script completed!</h3>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/gettingData.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									After a lot of research, trial, and error, and getting familiar with Unity. The audio data was now being captured, and I got 
									the first audio script working! 
								</p>
								<p>
									Now it was time to use that data to manipulate an object, and utilizing an asset called Visualizer Studio helped me accomplish that goal.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/blueWorking.gif" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Project concept</h3>
								<p>
									Now that an object was reacting to audio, I needed to conceptualize the user experience further. What would the user be doing in this 
									application? After some deliberation, I decided to have the user experience be more of a chill interactive experience. An experience where 
									the user would not be overwhelmed by many visual elements but let the user focus on a few compelling objects within the environment.
								</p>
								<h3>Needed features</h3>								
								<ul>
									<li>Objects to represent audio highs, mids, and lows</li>
									<li>VR integration</li>
									<li>User abilities: force push and force pull</li>
									<li>Respawn system for cubes</li>
									<li>Needed a sky for the environment</li>
									<li>Post-Processing effects to make the environment and objects visually appealing</li>									
								</ul>	
								<h3>Build and challenges</h3>
								<p>Within the 3 month timeframe, all planned features were completed by the project deadline. Many lessons were learned throughout the 
									project, and many blockers were overcome.</p>							
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cubeGrab.png" alt="" /></span>
								<br>
								<h3>Project Completion</h3>
								<p>A few realizations were made throughout the project; I loved the challenge of jumping into the unknown and building something compelling. 
									I also realized that this is what I want to do for the future, so I changed my major to gain the coding foundations necessary to create 
									compelling experiences. </p>

								<h2 class="major">BC IBIT Capstone VR Class</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/class.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									For this time-sensitive project, we had about a week and a half to get an entire capstone class into virtual reality 
									before the end of the quarter. As a team, we devised a plan, split up our tasks, and researched various VR applications 
									that would potentially be a good fit for the class in VR. We landed on Rec Room as the VR application that would best suit our 
									needs as the social room capacity in Rec Room exceeded the class capacity of 17 students. RecRoom also has some amazing environmental 
									editing tools that allowed us to build the environment to have different themed areas for each capstone team's project and a main area 
									for the whole class.
								</p>
								<p>
									We then built out the environment, hand delivered VR headsets to each student, and provided recorded instruction for the 
									entire class. 
								</p>
								<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vh55CSXi7Ug"></iframe></div>
								<br>
								<p>
									The VR class was a major success for the XR Lab. It was the first of its kind for the college and possibly the State of Washington, and 
									I'm proud to have played a major role in every stage of the project.
